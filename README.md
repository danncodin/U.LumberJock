Lumberjock is an idle clicker game, made by me and my classmates for a college semester project.

## History

A world full of trees to discover, young lumberjack Jock sets out on a journey around the globe to discover the wood of several of these magical living sculptures that feed our world.

Exploring forests and writing everything down in his little diary, Jock also makes friends and learns about the cultures of the various places where he hopes to fulfill his dream of discovering all the trees in his world.
